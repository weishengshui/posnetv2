# Hibernate JDBC and Connection Properties

#
# We use C3P0 connection pooling to check the validity of the connection.
#
# Just add any c3p0 specific parameters with config key begin with
# 'db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.'.
#
# See the following URL for complete C3P0 configuration:
# http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/index.html#configuration
#
# List of configuration properties:
# http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/index.html#configuration_properties
#

# The classname of a custom org.hibernate.connection.ConnectionProvider 
# which provides JDBC connections to Hibernate. 
db.ext.hibernate.connection.provider_class=org.hibernate.connection.C3P0ConnectionProvider

# 
# C3P0 Basic Pool Configuration
#

# Determines how many connections at a time c3p0 will try to acquire when the 
# pool is exhausted. Default is 3. 
#db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.acquireIncrement=3

# Number of Connections a pool will try to acquire upon startup. Should be 
# between minPoolSize and maxPoolSize. 
# db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.initialPoolSize=3

# Minimum number of JDBC connections in the pool.
# Default: 3
db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.minPoolSize=5

# Maximum number of Connections a pool will maintain at any given time. 
# Default: 15.
db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.maxPoolSize=20


#
# C3P0: Managing Pool Size and Connection Age
#

# Seconds, effectively a time to live. A Connection older than 
# maxConnectionAge will be destroyed and purged from the pool. This differs 
# from maxIdleTime in that it refers to absolute age. Even a Connection 
# which has not been much idle will be purged from the pool if it exceeds 
# maxConnectionAge. Zero means no maximum absolute age is enforced.
# Default: 0 
#db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.maxConnectionAge=0

# Seconds a Connection can remain pooled but unused before being discarded. 
# Zero means idle connections never expire.
# Default: 0 
db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.maxIdleTime=1800


#
# C3P0: Configuring Connection Testing
#

# If this is a number greater than 0, c3p0 will test all idle, pooled but 
# unchecked-out connections, every this number of seconds.
# Default: 0 
#db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.idleConnectionTestPeriod=0

# Defines the query that will be executed for all connection tests, if the 
# default ConnectionTester (or some other implementation of 
# QueryConnectionTester, or better yet FullQueryConnectionTester) is 
# being used.
#
# See http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/index.html#preferredTestQuery 
#
# Default: null
#db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.preferredTestQuery=


# If true, an operation will be performed asynchronously at every connection 
# check-in to verify that the connection is valid. Use in combination with 
# idleConnectionTestPeriod for quite reliable, always asynchronous 
# Connection testing. Also, setting an automaticTestTable or 
# preferredTestQuery will usually speed up all connection tests.
#
# Default: false
#db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.testConnectionOnCheckin=true


# Use only if necessary. Expensive. If true, an operation will be performed 
# at every connection checkout to verify that the connection is valid. 
# Better choice: verify connections periodically using 
# idleConnectionTestPeriod. Also, setting an automaticTestTable or 
# preferredTestQuery will usually speed up all connection tests
#
# See http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/index.html#testConnectionOnCheckout
# See db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.idleConnectionTestPeriod
#
# Default: false
db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.testConnectionOnCheckout=true


#
# C3P0: Configuring Statement Pooling
#

# The size of c3p0's global PreparedStatement cache. If both 
# maxStatements and maxStatementsPerConnection are zero, statement 
# caching will not be enabled. If maxStatements is zero but 
# maxStatementsPerConnection is a non-zero value, statement caching 
# will be enabled, but no global limit will be enforced, 
# only the per-connection maximum. maxStatements controls the total number 
# of Statements cached, for all Connections. If set, it should be a 
# fairly large number, as each pooled Connection requires its own, distinct 
# flock of cached statements. As a guide, consider how many distinct 
# PreparedStatements are used frequently in your application, and multiply 
# that number by maxPoolSize to arrive at an appropriate value. Though 
# maxStatements is the JDBC standard parameter for controlling statement 
# caching, users may find c3p0's alternative maxStatementsPerConnection 
# more intuitive to use.
#
# Default: 0
db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.maxStatements=50


# The number of PreparedStatements c3p0 will cache for a single pooled 
# Connection.
#
# For detail, please see 
# http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/index.html#maxStatementsPerConnection 
#
# Default: 0
db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.maxStatementsPerConnection=10


#
# CP30: Configuring Recovery From Database Outages
#

# Defines how many times c3p0 will try to acquire a new Connection from 
# the database before giving up. If this value is less than or equal to zero, 
# c3p0 will keep trying to fetch a Connection indefinitely.
#
# Default: 30
#db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.acquireRetryAttempts=30


# Milliseconds, time c3p0 will wait between acquire attempts. 
#
# Default: 1000
#db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.acquireRetryDelay=1000

# If true, a pooled DataSource will declare itself broken and be permanently 
# closed if a Connection cannot be obtained from the database after making 
# acquireRetryAttempts to acquire one. If false, failure to obtain a 
# Connection will cause all Threads waiting for the pool to acquire a 
# Connection to throw an Exception, but the DataSource will remain valid, 
# and will attempt to acquire again following a call to getConnection().
#
# Default: false
#db.ext.hibernate.c3p0.breakAfterAcquireFailure=false
